Models,Ideal model setup for entity relationships.
Business Logic,"Looks amazing. Code is logical, readable, and well documented."
Controllers,"Very cleanly organized and well documented controllers. HTTP endpoints and service connections look great. Very, very minor optimization, the functions for getting all players in a tournament and the same but with a limit could be combined into one by adding ""required = false"" to the @RequestParam annotation."
Error Handling,Error handling looks very good for all possible findById failure points.
Git History,"Long and equally shared commit history, replete with pull requests. Excellent job."
Documentation,"Very well detailed comments in the non-""basic CRUD"" functions. Descriptive comments throughout."
Overall,Absolutely excellent. Great work.
