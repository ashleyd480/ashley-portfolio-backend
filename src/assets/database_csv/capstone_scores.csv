Back-End Development,Error Handling and Validation,5,4,"The method authUserSignup returns plain strings for error messages, which is not a good practice. It should return standardized error responses. Just a tip:- Using general RuntimeException can be improved by defining specific custom exceptions for different error scenarios."

Functionality and Code Quality,Functionality,5,4,"The method searchPlaces performs multiple database calls in a loop, which can be inefficient. Consider using a more efficient query or batch processing."
Functionality and Code Quality,Code Quality,5,4,Hardcoded Values in react: Avoid hardcoding values like image paths. Use imports or a configuration file.
