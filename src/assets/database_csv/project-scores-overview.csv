7,3rd formal project (backend),"• Excellent README documentation and checklist as usual.
 • Great ERD diagram.
 • Remove the password from your application.properties file.
 • AOP is implemented well, but look into the @Around aspect with other implementations beyond logging.
 • Nice use and understanding of RestTemplateConfig and the bean. I really like the comment there as well.
 • Excellent overall code comments; just use block-style commenting /* */ for method-level comments.
 • Look into a library called ModelMapper for mapping in your update logic.
 • Very clean controller layer code.
 • Excellent error handling and response with messages.
 • Excellent handling of edge cases.
 • Nice method chaining for adding comments.
 • Nice use of JPA methods for searching and great to see you went beyond the requirements by implementing searching functionality.
 • Great job with the PATCH controller!
 • Great job with test data seeding; this is professional-level work.
 • Great job asking very informative and detailed questions and providing tips in the channel. You are a true team player, and that is as important as development.

Oh wow! that is very impressive ashley. Awesome work. Can you demo this after the HW review?",FALSE
10,capstone project (fullstack),"Ashley’s project presentation is outstanding, and the app demonstrates high usability with excellent documentation and planning. The user accessibility features, particularly the screen reader support and low sensory design, are impressive. Incorporating feedback from previous projects, such as the seeder and model mapper, shows great adaptability. The sign-in checks, error handling in components, and use of local storage and software engineering principles are well-executed. Her investigation into using location hooks in React and the implementation of JPQL and error pages are commendable. Suggestions include changing the app name in the document title and removing hardcoded values like the rating array.
 

Ashley is a superstar and a very intuitive learner who always stays on top of the content. She could be a great asset to any team, and I would love to work with her as a peer programmer. She asks insightful questions in class and learns quickly. I highly recommend her for any team! Additionally, Ashley should look into full stack development and focus more time on data structures and algorithms next (start from basic to advanced). Truly impressed and highly recommend her for any team!""	",TRUE
